  <p><strong>Server Logs</strong></p>
  <p>Our hosting provider collects website access data and saves the data in &quot;server log files&quot;, the following (known) data is written to the log files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Browser type</li>
    <li>Operating system</li>
    <li>Server access on/when</li>
    <li>Amount of data sent</li>
    <li>Referrer URL</li>
    <li>Computer host name</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The data is used for statistical purposes only, but, Free CSS reserves the right in retrospective effect to check server log files should evidence be available that indicates illegal / unlawful use of the Free CSS website.</p>
  <p>Our provider stores Log Files for a maximum of 9 weeks, after this time the files are permanently deleted from the server.</p>
  <p>IP addresses that are in the log files are anonymised by our provider after a period of 7 days, this is to our knowledge, automated. The anonymisation ensures the process of identifying a natural person via the IP address is not possible.</p>
